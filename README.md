## About
_Ungrievable Subjects_ highlights the collective loss of life incurred during the Covid-19 pandemic and how these deaths are often forgotten in a societal attempt to return to normalcy. Data and statistics collected by the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, while considered skewed based on reporting and collection methods, retains an archive, a testament to the tremendous level of loss of life, during the time period between March 2020 and the United States’ federal declaration of the end of the COVID-19 PHE (public health emergency) on May 11, 2023. Over one million lives have been lost in the United States alone, and yet public grieving is nearly absent. Instead, loss of life is largely forgotten in the rush to “return to normal” and resume in-person activities. In light of this, what does it mean when the machine remembers and keeps alive what the general population would like to forget? 


Grievability, according to Judith Butler, is a necessary precondition for a life to be deemed worthy of being lost. Lives that were considered ungrievable from the outset due to devaluation through structural and systemic disenfranchisement are also lives that have been rendered as unworthy of remembrance or mourning. Medical Anthropologist Martha Lincoln revisited this concept of grievability in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, examining the United States’ response within the frame of necrosecurity and immunosupremacy. In this case, illness and mortality were cast as a form of nationalist warfare with acceptable losses from the pandemic being debated as necessary to preserve the economy, and the distinctly American way of life (capitalist consumption.) 


What are the implications of constructing a machine, composed of custom built electronics, code, and fabricated parts, to grieve the ungrievable for us? How does the machine's ability to perseverate indefinitely on “ungrievable subjects” animate and embody those losses? Judith Butler writes “Without grievability, there is no life, or, rather, there is something living that is other than life.” The “something living that is other than life” that Butler describes is embodied by the machine’s actions, and enlivened by its operations.
